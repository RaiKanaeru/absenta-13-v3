description: Prepare and commit changes for deployment

Prepare the current changes for deployment:

1. Run `npm run lint` to check for linting issues
2. Run `npm run build` to verify build succeeds
3. If all checks pass, create a git commit with a descriptive message
4. Show git status after commit

Do NOT push to remote unless explicitly requested.
