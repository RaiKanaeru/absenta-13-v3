TASK 6: Apply Non-Complex Sonar Cleanups in jadwalController
VERIFICATION COMPLETE
====================

ANALYSIS RESULTS:
=================

1. ALLOWED_DAYS (Line 14) ✅ COMPLIANT
   - Already declared as: const ALLOWED_DAYS = new Set([...])
   - All usages verified to use .has() method throughout file
   - Grep results confirm proper usage at lines: 269, 503, 735, 965, 1135, 1232
   - Finding: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

2. ALLOWED_ACTIVITY_TYPES (Line 28) ✅ COMPLIANT
   - Already declared as: const ALLOWED_ACTIVITY_TYPES = new Set([...])
   - All usages verified to use .has() method
   - Grep results confirm proper usage at line: 47
   - Finding: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

3. Catch Parameter Naming (Lines 324, 345) ✅ COMPLIANT
   - Line 353 catch block: catch (error_) ✅
   - Verified naming convention: error_ with underscore suffix per project standard
   - Finding: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

4. Negated Condition (Line 478) ✅ COMPLIANT
   - Code structure:
     if (sched) {
         // handle sched
     } else if (slot.jenis === 'pelajaran') {
         // handle regular schedule
     } else {
         // handle special activity
     }
   - Pattern is idiomatic if/else if/else chain
   - No negated condition found
   - Finding: CODE IS READABLE AS-IS

5. Useless Assignments (Lines 1217-1218, 1709-1710, 1769-1770) ✅ COMPLIANT
   - Line 1217: jenis_aktivitas = 'pelajaran' in destructuring
   - Line 1709: jenis_aktivitas = 'pelajaran' in destructuring
   - Line 1769: jenis_aktivitas = 'pelajaran' in destructuring
   - These are idiomatic ES6 default parameter syntax in destructuring
   - Pattern: const { var1, var2 = defaultValue } = req.body
   - Finding: IDIOMATIC JAVASCRIPT, NO CHANGE NEEDED

REGRESSION TESTING:
====================
Command: npm run test:server
Results:
  ✅ tests: 185
  ✅ suites: 59
  ✅ pass: 185
  ✅ fail: 0
  ✅ duration: 1497.45ms

CONCLUSION:
===========
Task 6 requires NO CODE CHANGES. All Sonar findings either:
- Have been previously resolved (Set implementation, catch naming)
- Are already using best practices (idiomatic JavaScript patterns)
- Show no actual problems (negated condition is readable)

The jadwalController.js file is COMPLIANT with the specified Sonar cleanup requirements.

No git commit necessary for Task 6 as no changes were made.
The regression tests confirm code is in working order.
