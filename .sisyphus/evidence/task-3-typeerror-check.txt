Task 3 Evidence: Queue type-check TypeError verification
==========================================================
Date: 2026-02-19

## Change Applied
- File: server/services/system/queue-system.js:218
- Before: throw new Error('Valid userId is required')
- After:  throw new TypeError('Valid userId is required')
- Context: Guard uses Number.isFinite() which is a type check, so TypeError is semantically correct

## Test Results
- npm run test:server: 185 tests pass, 0 fail
- DownloadQueue file access tests (3/3 pass): 
  - purges expired file access entries ✅
  - falls back to filename ownership when map entry expired ✅
  - removes filepath from job status result ✅
- No queue behavior regression detected

## Verification
The TypeError is thrown in the addToQueue method when normalizedUserId fails
the Number.isFinite() check. This is a type-validation guard, so TypeError
is the correct error class per JavaScript conventions and SonarQube guidance.
