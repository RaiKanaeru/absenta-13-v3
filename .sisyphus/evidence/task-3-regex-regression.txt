Task 3 Evidence: Regex character-class duplicate analysis
==========================================================
Date: 2026-02-19

## Analysis
- Files analyzed: initializer.js:85, security-system.js:30
- Both files have identical regex: /^[a-zA-Z0-9\s_@.!#$%^&*()+=[\]{};':"\\|,<>/?`~-]+$/

## Duplicate Check Results
- Parsed 36 character-class elements (ranges + individuals + escape sequences)
- NO syntactic duplicates found (each element appears exactly once)
- NO semantic overlaps found (no individual chars overlap with range chars)
- The comment in security-system.js:29 confirms duplicates were ALREADY removed:
  "Fixed: removed duplicate characters (@, _, -, ()) from character class"

## Decision
- Regex is already clean — no edit needed
- Constraint: "Do not widen regex acceptance criteria beyond duplicate cleanup"
- Since no duplicates exist, modifying the regex would risk violating this constraint

## Test Results
- npm run test:server: 185 tests pass, 0 fail
- All validation tests pass, confirming regex behavior is correct
- No regex regression detected
