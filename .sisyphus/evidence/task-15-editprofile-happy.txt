Task 15 - EditProfile Happy Path Evidence
Date: 2026-02-19
Status: Success

1. Refactoring:
   - Extracted `useEditProfileForm` hook to handle form logic, validation, and submission.
   - Extracted `RoleSpecificFieldsTop`, `RoleSpecificFieldsBottom`, and `PasswordChangeForm` components.
   - Reduced `EditProfile.tsx` complexity significantly by moving logic out.

2. Verification:
   - ESLint passed with 0 errors.
   - `npm run test:client` passed all tests including `EditProfile.test.tsx`.
   - Tests cover rendering for different roles and form submission.

3. Key Improvements:
   - Separation of concerns: Logic in hook, UI in components.
   - Reduced cognitive complexity of the main component.
   - Improved maintainability and testability.
